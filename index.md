title: "Digital Earths â€“ Global hackathon"
---
 
**May 12-18 2025** 

At various sites -- Beijing, Boulder, Oxford, Sao Paulo, Stockholm, Tokyo -- around the world

The Global Hackathon will bring together scientists around the world to begin exploring the first ever coordinated experiments of km-scale climate models simulating a full annual cycle at horizontal grid spacings at km-scales (5 km or less) following a common protocol.  

Those participating in the Hackathon will be supported by regional nodes consisting of a common location for the hacking, an access to a combined data-compute resource hosting the data and proximate computing capbility for its analysis.  Each node will host at least one full annual cycle of output data standardized on a common (HEALPix) grid.  Standardizaiton will help participants share their analysis workflows to allow teams around the world to perform similar analyses across all the models hosted by the participating nodes, and thereby build global communities around common interests. 

## Goals

* accelerate the improvement and analysis of km-scale climate models (including regional models)
* socialize best practices in coding and data intensive applications (infrastructure and workflows)
* establish and disseminate the advantages of adopting common standards for km-scale climate information
* build solidarity and open access to resources

In addition individual centers may, as they wish, support other resources to supplement the standardized model outputs.  This could include output from km-scale regional models (ideally standardized similarly to the global models), or km-scale satellite data.  Likewise computing capabilities could be augmented to support the application of machine learning. 

## Organization

A scientific steering committee is responsible for the organization and will be supported by sub-committees for technical and logistical issues.

Participating teams around the world will assign someone to the sub-committees and is welcome to nominate a member for the scientific steering committee.
