# Requirements (rough):

- Combined data and compute to support at least 100 users analyzing at least 100 TB data sets.
- 1PB data resource (100TB minimum)
- Large (1000) multi-core analysis platforms with fast access to data resource (could be separate from meeting place) and JUPYTER support.
- One DYAMOND-Annual Simulation on HEALPIX (other data and other formats can be hosted as desired, but each participatn must host at least one standardized dataset).
