Each node will host at least one full annual cycle of output data standardized on a common (HEALPix) grid. Standardization will help participants share their analysis workflows with other teams analyzing other models at other nodes, and thereby build global communities around common interests."

Also, we can check and see what different IT department could provide if something is not available at the venue from the start.\n\nvideo streaming for opening and closing sessions (?), keynotes(?)\nstable wifi connection in all rooms; the traffic isn’t too much, since the data is processed at the computing centers, but the connections should be stable\nenough power outlets in the group rooms\n\n\n\nCatering\nthis can be adjusted depending on our budget\n\nusually two coffee breaks per full day\nand lunch\nin Berlin and Vienna, dinners were included, only one dinner was included in Madrid, Hamburg and Wageningen\npossibly an ice breaker event on the first evening\nsome snacks (fruits, etc.) and beverages to be accessible also outside of coffee breaks were very well received",
